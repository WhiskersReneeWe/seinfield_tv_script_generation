# Seinfieldtv Script Generation with Pytorch 

## Project Introduction

In this project, I employ LSTM model in Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to train the real Seinfield scripts and then generate new lines. This is my first dabble into the fascinating world of RNN and its applications words and languages. The main goal for this project is to work out a properly trained model using Pytorch framework, albeit imperfect, to learn the basic structure and logic of LSTM. 

## Python Modules

* numpy
* torch.nn
* torch.utils - for dataloaders
